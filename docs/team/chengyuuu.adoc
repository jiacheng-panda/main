== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the commands that allow users to manage their events in a scheduler*
** What it does: The `add` command allows user to create events in the scheduler. Repeated events can be created by specifying how they want the events to be repeat. +
The `edit` command is used to edit either single event or repeating events. The `delete` command enables user to either delete a single event or repeating events.
** Justification: These features are important because it allow students to keep track of their past, present and future schedules which enables them to have better time management.
** Highlights:  This enhancement involves adding commands to aid in scheduling of events. Updates were made to various components such as `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage`.
A singleton pattern class `RepeatEventGenerator` was also created to assist in generating repeated events according to command parsed.
