== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to sync with Google Calendar commands*
** What it does: allows the user to create/edit/delete the events on local database as well as Google Calendar in real time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to push local events to Goole Calendar/ get events from Google instead of using a blank local databse.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement 1*: added a offline mode switch to allow user use it offline without any error.
* *Minor enhancement 2*: added a welcome page and automatically becomes the log-in page after few seconds.
