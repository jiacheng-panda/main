== Introduction

iScheduler Xs Max is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for scheduling personal events*. More importantly,
this version is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, we can get your event scheduling tasks done
faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

This product is targetting at *University students* who have many tasks to handle such as homework deadlines, weekly lectures and tutorials, anniversaries with families and more. +

The postfix 'Xs Max' indicates a great improvement from the previous version of the product as it now supports Google Calendar! +

Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `iScheduler Xs Max.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your iScheduler Xs Max.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. +
Below is an screenshot of the GUI after logging in the Google Calendar.

+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add`**: `add n/Interview at Jane Street` : adds an Event named `Interview at Jane Street` to the Event Scheduler.
* *`list`* : lists all events
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd event shown in the current event
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[WARNING]
As a normal user (new user who does not understand the implementation of the app), you should not modify the data files or tokens manually, such edits would lead to various errors and exceptions. +

== Features

====
*Command Format* +
 -- Some commands have (an) alias(es), which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add an event to the
scheduler, you can type either `add n/Interview at Jane Street` or `a n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/EVENT_NAME`, `EVENT_NAME` is a
parameter which can be used as `add n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/EVENT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Interview at Jane Street
t/serious` or as `n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/priority.low`, `t/fun t/serious` etc. +
 -- Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/EVENT_NAME v/VENUE`, `v/VENUE n/EVENT_NAME` is also
acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help` +
Aliases: `hel` OR `he` OR `h` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::add[]
=== Adding an event : `add`

Adds an event to the scheduler. +
Format: `add event n/EVENT_NAME [s/START_DATETIME] [e/END_DATETIME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [v/VENUE] [r/REMARK] [rt/REPEAT_TYPE]
[ru/REPEAT_UNTIL_DATETIME] [t/TAG]... [re/REMINDER_TIME]… ` +
// end::add[]
Aliases: `ad` OR `a` in place of `add` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::add[]
[TIP]
An event can have any number of tags and reminders(including 0).
If you want multiple tags and reminders, we need to use `[t/]` and [`re/`] for multiple times

[WARNING]
Except for tags(t/) and reminders(re/), all other fields will take in the latest field that is being input.

****
* `DATETIME` is the natural language of date and time in English.
* `REPEAT_TYPE` should be left empty or chosen from either daily, weekly or monthly.
* `REMINDER_TIME` (in `xxHxxMxxS`) represents the duration before the `START_DATETIME` that you want a pop-up alert.
* Adding events with the exact values as another event is possible.
* Only future reminders will be added. Please refer to <<Pop Up Feature>>.

// tag::addTag[]
=== [Partial Implementation] Adding a tag : `addTag` [by v2.0]
This is the command format for adding tags.

*Note:* This feature has NOT been fully implemented yet. However, do feel free to play around with it and to report any
bugs/problems as well :)

_It will be FULLY implemented by v2.0._
// end::addTag[]

=== Listing all events : `list`

Shows a list of all events in the scheduler. +
Format: `list` +
Aliases: `lis` OR `li` OR `l` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::edit[]
=== Editing an event : `edit`

Edits existing events in the scheduler. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/EVENT_NAME] [s/START_DATETIME] [e/END_DATETIME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [v/VENUE] [rt/REPEAT_TYPE]
[ru/REPEAT_UNTIL_DAETIME] [t/TAG]... [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]` +
// end::edit[]
Aliases: `edi` OR `ed` in place of `edit` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::edit[]
[TIP]
Only one option can exists at any one time. Either `-a` or `-u`.

****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed event list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the event will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the event's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* The logic for editing reminder times is the same as tags
* Only future reminders will be edited. Please refer to <<Pop Up Feature>>.
* Repeating events can be edited together using a valid option.
* `REPEAT_TYPE` and `REPEAT_UNTIL_DATETIME` cannot be edited for single events and events without a valid option.
****
// end::edit[]

The supported formats of date, time and reminder times are identical to that of
<<Adding an event : `add`, Adding an event>>. +
Refer to <<Date and time formats>> and <<Reminder time format>>.

[NOTE]
====
The current version does not auto-refresh the Google Calendar page on the right.
Please right click and select 'Reload Page' to see the effects.
Alternatively, you can select any Event using your keyboard (by using arrow keys) / mouse (by clicking on it), the page on the right will be refreshed.
====

// tag::edit[]
:sectnums!:
==== Options
`-a` +
Tell the command to select all the repeating events that are associated with the event selected.

`-u` +
Tell the command to select the upcoming events that are associated with the event selected.

Examples:

// end::edit[]
* `edit 1 n/Study with John d/Study for Mathematics exam` +
Edits the event name and description of the 1st event to be `Study with John` and `Study for Mathematics exam`
respectively.
// tag::edit[]
* `edit 2 n/Play t/ -a` +
Edits all the repeating event's name of the 2nd event to be `Play` and clears all existing tags.
// end::edit[]
* `edit 2 re/ -u` +
Clear all the upcoming event's reminder times.


[WARNING]
=====
If your repeating events have different fields, using `-a | -u` options will overwrite individuality. +
i.e. different fields of other repeating events will be replaced by the fields of event identified by the index. +
Below is a detailed example
=====

`add n/Event v/NUS ...`:
|===
|1. Name: Event |Venue: NUS |...
|2. Name: Event |Venue: NUS |...
|3. Name: Event |Venue: NUS |...
|===
You added a set of 3 recurring events

`edit 1 n/CHANGE`:
|===
|1. Name: CHANGE |Venue: NUS |...
|2. Name: Event  |Venue: NUS |...
|3. Name: Event  |Venue: NUS |...
|===
You edited event 1 only. Now the set of recurring events have different fields.


`edit 2 v/NTU -a`:
|===
|1. Name: Event| Venue: NTU |...
|2. Name: Event| Venue: NTU |...
|3. Name: Event| Venue: NTU |...
|===
Different fields of first event will be overwritten by fields of the second event as identified by the INDEX used in the command .

:sectnums:


=== Listing all events : `list`

Shows a list of all events in the scheduler. +
Format: `list` +
Aliases: `lis` OR `li` OR `l` +
_Coming in V1.4: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_


=== Locating events by event name: `find`

* Only the event name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Work` will not match `Works`
* Events matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hard Work` will return `Work Smart`,
`Play Hard`
****

// tag::Reminder Feature[]
=== Reminder Operations: `addReminder` `deleteReminder` `postponeReminder`
Customised commands to add, delete reminders incrementally, and postpone all reminders for the event. +

If you have set reminder for an event, a window will pop up at the specified duration before event start time. +
You can find event name, venue, start and end time information in the pop up window. +
Eg: If you set 30min for an event that starts at 11:00, a window will pop up at 10:30 (+-1min) if the app is open. +

General Format: +
`addReminder/ deleteReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]`. +
`postponeReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME] [-a | -u]`. (multiple durations not allowed) +
At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time. +
For the correct format for time, please refer to <<Reminder time format>>. +

You may choose to use `add` or `edit` command to set this field with prefix `re`. +
Please refer to  <<Adding an event : `add`>> and <<Editing an event : `edit`>> command. +

****
* If you have not set any reminder for the event, the event card will display as "No Reminder".
* When you open the app, it will NOT pop up past reminders since the last time you close the app. +
Eg. If you open the app at 11am, the reminder at 10am will not pop up when you open the app.
* When you add/edit reminder times, past reminders will be displayed on the event card but will not pop up. +
Eg. you add a reminder that is supposed to pop up an hour ago, the duration will still be displayed on the event card but will never pop up since the reminder time has already passed.
* When the reminder pops up, the reminder time displayed will not be deleted.
****

[WARNING]
=====
The reminder commands follow the same logic as `edit`. +
If your repeating events have different fields, using `-a | -u` options will overwrite individuality. +
i.e. different fields of other repeating events will be replaced by the fields of event identified by the index. +
For detailed explanations, refer to <<Editing an event : `edit`>>.
=====

==== Add reminders to event: `addReminder`
Add new reminders to events incrementally +
Format: `addReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]`. At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time.

Examples:

* `addReminder 1 re/30M` +
Add a reminder 30min before Event 1 start time
* `addReminder 1 re/30M -a` +
Add a reminder 30min before start time for all repeating events of Event 1.

[NOTE]
=====
* If Event 1 already has reminders at 30m, 1h before the start time, and you want to add another 2h reminder, the following commands are equivalent: +
`edit 1 re/30m re/1h re/2h` = `addReminder 1 re/2h`
* If you add a duration that already exists in the event, it will have no effect.
=====

==== Delete reminders from event: `deleteReminder`
Delete reminders of events if it exists +
Format: `deleteReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]`. At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time. +

[TIP]
====
To avoid unexpected behavior, please enter the exact duration displayed in the event card.
====

Examples:

* `deleteReminder 1 re/30M` +
Delete a reminder 30min before Event 1 start time if the reminder exists.
* `addReminder 1 re/30M re/1H -a` +
Delete reminders 30min and 1h before start time for all repeating events of Event 1 if the reminders exist.

[NOTE]
=====
* If Event 1 already has reminders at 30m, 1h, 2h before the start time, and you want to delete the 1h reminder, the following commands are equivalent: +
  `edit 1 re/30m re/2h` = `deleteReminder 1 re/1h`
* If you delete a duration that does not exist in the event, it will have no effect.
=====

==== Postpone all reminders for event: `postponeReminder`
Postpone all reminders for events. If the postpone duration is larger than the original duration, reminder duration will become 0S.
Format: `postponeReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME] [-a | -u]`. At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time. +

[TIP]
====
Please enter only ONE duration to postpone here.
====

Examples:

* Event 1 has reminders 30min, 1H before the start time. +
`postponeReminder 1 re/5M` +
Reminders displayed become: 25min, 55min.

* Event 1 has reminders 30min, 1H before the start time. +
`postponeReminder 1 re/2H` +
Reminders displayed become: 0S. Reminders will pop up right at the start time.

[NOTE]
=====
* If the identified event has no reminders, it will have no effect.

// tag::EnterGoogleCalendarMode[]
=== EnterGoogleCalendarMode : `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`
*Function of this command*: This command initializes the app to enterGoogle Calendar mode. The followings are done: Pull events from your Google Calendar (login required), add them to local calendar and enable all feasures' real-time sycn feature with Google Calendar. +

*Format*: `EnterGoogleCalendarMode` +
[WARNING]
Note that you shall NOT type any extra input after the command word `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`. Behaviour is not guaranteed.

[NOTE]
====
For events downloaded from Google, commands on them only have local effects. No real-time effects on the original events on Google Calendar. They will be supported in v2.0.
====

By default, that is, before initialization (before a normal user enters the `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`), the app is in *Offline Mode*. All command effects are local. +

When the user types the command `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`, then a pop-up windows will appear in your *default browser* for you to log in your google account and establish the link between app and Google Server.

[NOTE]
====
This command will have to access your Google Calendar data, Google authentication is required.
====

==== Log-in Process Overview

[NOTE]
Take note that you will be required to log in *twice*.

- *First login:* Establishing the link between the app and google calendar. This is done at the webpage pop-up in your default browser. *This log-in credential is stored locally*. If the credential has not expired, you can continue to use it and no further log-in is required.
- *Second login:* log-in for viewing the Google Calendar on the right panel. This is log-in from the webpage on the right panel. *Note that the cookies are not stored. You will be required to log in again if you close the app*.

[NOTE]
====
Note for Log-In Process
====
****
After the pop-up window appears, you shall enter your *account number* and *password*. +
You shall *not* close the login page. +
If you have done so, the app is very like to become inactive and unable to accept any command. +

Remedial action For any log-in problem: +
- You should try to enter the command `EnterGoogleCalendarMode` again.

If the problem persists, try the following: +

- Close the app.
- Delete the `StoredCredential` file in your `token` folder found in the app home folder.
- Make sure the content of `mode.txt` file is 'Disabled'. Note that this file shall NOT be deleted at any time. If it is missing, the app is likely to have unexpected behaviour.
****

[NOTE]
====
Note for two-factor authentication (2FA) of your Google Account
====
****
The app might able / not able to support your 2FA log in method, depends on the security level set by you.
If the internet is not good, the login page might not appear.

*Step 1:* If you have not successfully logged into our application using `EnterGoogleCalendarMode` before, a pop-up login window will appear in your default browser.

*Step 2:* You will be required to log in your Google account, just like when you are using many other Google services. After successful authorization, the message +
`Received verification code. You may now close the window.` +
will appear.

*Step 3:* The application proceeds automatically after successful authorization. As instructed, you do not have to do anything else so please do feel free to close the browser tab.

*Step 4:* The application then proceeds with the pulling of Google Calendar events, and trying to add them to the local database. A success message appears after the completion of addition of supported events. If your google event is not supported, an error message is shown.

[TIP]
*Supported event types:* +
- *Single events* +
- *Repeated* events with single *weekly* repeat day with a 'Repeat Until' date and with a Name. eg.Weekly On Monday Until 2018-12-12 (This is mainly to support for weekly lectures and tutorials) +
Event(s) above refer to those generated in Google natively and NOT generated from the app previously (from your current computer or any other computer using any accounts.)

[NOTE]
If Google service is not stable OR the limit of the IP address/account is reached OR there are too many events, the command might not able to retrieve *any* event.
One of the third party libraries used in our app Natty has been noticed several times for unstable/incorrect behaviour in converting DateTimes. Repeated Events might not be able to fe fully downloaded.

==== Using the feature

Now you are in the Google Calendar mode, the supported commands will have real-time effects on your log-in Google Calendar. The supported commands are: +
`add` / `edit` /`delete`/`clear` /`addReminder` / `deleteReminder`/ `postponeReminder` +
For those events in local before initialization, this feature does NOT push them to Google Calendar. Editing those events only in local database will have an error.


[WARNING]
====
*No concurrent usage of the same account*
====
****
Your Google Account used for this app should only be *you*. We do not support multiple people using the same account. Examples of possible problems:

- If more than one person is using the account, more events might showed in the calendar panel compared to the left panel. +

- The real-time effect is only for local commands, commands entered from anywhere else (except the app you are using right now) are not captured in your app. However, they will affect your Google Calenar. When they type `*clear*`, the events on your Google Calendar will be *cleared*. Your local database is not affected.
****

[WARNING]
====
*No using of multiple accounts*
====
****
This is not supported. Switching of account is also not supported. For the advanced user, if you do want to switch, please close the app and delete the `StoredCredential` file in the `token` folder. However, the behaviour is not guaranteed. A more user-friendly command will be supported in v2.0.
****

[WARNING]
====
*No Commands Shall be executed on Event(s) already passed (before current time)*
====
****
Due to Google's optimization, effect of commands on such events is not guaranteed. It may or may not be executed.
****

[NOTE]
====
Possible different implementation of our app and Google
====
****
Note that this version is still v1.4 and we are not able to fully understand the implementation of Google Calendar on their side. +
Some failure/exception caused by Google Calendar will cause the local command to fail as well.
We can *only guarantee the command sent from the app is the same as intended*. However, we are not able to guarantee how Google interprets the command, and how they implement the behaviour of the command. It is expected to see different behaviours. That being said, we have tried as much as possible to ensure similar behaviour.
****
Below is an example of a different implementation. +
- For interpretation on 'repeat until' date, various commands such as `add` and `edit` on repeated events might have different results on Google Calendar.

- For an event across different days. Locally, it is shown as one item. Google's way of showing it might seem like multiple items because the start time and end time is not shown.

[NOTE]
====
Disclaimer
====
****
- Event Description feature is partially depreciated in this version. The description is not shown in the app. +
- Tag is not supported for syc with Google in this verion, will be supported in v2.0.
- For auto-refreshing of the webpage on the right panel, its behaviour is not guaranteed because it much depends on your local set up. It may or may not auto-refresh. Also, When you do not see the expected outcome, please ensure your webpage is refreshed.
****

[NOTE]
====
Poor internet condition
====
****
No effects are on Google Calendar, only local effects. Depends on your internet quality, the command might not work as intended. Special locations such as school, dormitory and hotel, its firewall might affect our app. However, due to the complex Internet environment, we might not able to capture all internet connection problem. +

For captured error, it is reported as "`Internet Error/Status File Does Not Exist.`" OR `"Only local changes`" OR "`no effects on your Google Calendar`" OR "Unable to retrieve" OR their combinations. +

Please try your command again when the quality improves. or use `postGCEvents` Command to post local effects to Google Calendar.
